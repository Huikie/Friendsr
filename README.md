# Friendsr app

## Explanation of the app
For this app, I've created a social friends app that allows users to view peopleâ€™s profiles and some information about them. When the user first loads the app, it will show a list of available users. The user can click on each one to see a bigger photo and get more information about that user. On this screen there is also a way to rate the user.

## Implemented extra's
- I made rotation of the app user friendly by creating a landscape mode for the friend profile page and by preserving data when the user rotates the screen or closes the app.

This extra's are shown in the section "Screenshots of the app" (third image).
