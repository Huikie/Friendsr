For this app, I've created an social friends app that allows users to view peopleâ€™s profiles and some information about them. When the user first loads the app, it will show a list of available users. The user can click on each one to see a bigger photo and get more information about that user. On the screen is a way to rate the user. The app is compatible to users that want to use the app in landscape mode as shown in the third image below.
